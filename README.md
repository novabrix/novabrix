## == Hello, Hello! I'm Idriisüëã ==

I'm an aspiring **full-stack web developer** constantly working to better myself. My main skill is **combining art and logic** to make something beautiful! I started my development journey around 6 months ago, but I believe I can get there with hard work and determination! ‚ô•Ô∏è

Next Steps: Getting a **junior webdev internship** through Genesys Works and finishing **The Odin Project**!
